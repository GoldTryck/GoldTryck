# Welcome to my GitHub profile
## About me
Hello, I'm Hector, a 24-year-old student pursuing a degree in computer science at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. I'm passionate about continuously expanding my knowledge in the field of information technology, with a particular focus on data analysis and machine learning.

## In my free time 
You'll often find me engrossed in coding, exploring new programming languages, and working on personal tech projects. I thrive on the challenges of problem-solving and enjoy diving deep into the world of algorithms and data.

## Beyond the world of technology
I have a diverse range of interests. I have an immense appreciation for music in all its forms, and I'm constantly on the lookout for new sounds and genres to explore. Music, for me, is a source of inspiration and relaxation.

Another passion of mine is chess. I find the game's complexity and strategic depth both stimulating and satisfying. It's a mental exercise that I enjoy, and I'm always eager to improve my skills on the chessboard.

## Finally
I believe in lifelong learning, and I'm excited about the opportunities that the world of technology and data analysis offers. As I progress in my academic and personal journey, I look forward to contributing to the ever-evolving landscape of information technology.

Thank you for visiting my profile, and I hope you find something of interest here, whether it's technology, music, or the age-old game of chess.
